# Open Trivia API Quiz Generator
I made this as a [100 Days of Code Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) challenge.
Go to [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and Select Type True/False and generate an API.
Go to the API link and copy/paste that into ```open_question_bank_data``` in ```data.py```.
Delete ```{"response_code":0,"results":``` in the beginning and ```}``` in the end.
Then you just run the ```ClassQuiz.py```.
