### Day 4: November 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I did day 4 of the python course and made a rock paper scissors game. I also integrated Twitter API to my dashboard project to pull 5 tweets from my timeline and I also can tweet from my dashboard.

**Thoughts** The python course is too easy so far. I hope it gets more challenging soon!

### Day 5: December 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of python and had a legitimately challenging exercise. I also made Bamboo Forest using Twitter API which allows users to tweet anonymously.

### Day 8: December 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 of Python! Made a caesar encryption automater.

### Day 9: December 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 of python. Created a blind auction application.

**Thoughts** This challenge was not very well thought out because it's supposed to be a python dictionary challenge and the dictionary is inessential to achieving the end result.
