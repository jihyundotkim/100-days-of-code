### Day 1: November 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I made a little response time tester.

**Thoughts** I learned a bit about JavaScript and ended up finding a simple solution to a problem I encountered. I feel accomplished!

### Day 2: November 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started 100 days of python course by Angela Yu. Did day 1 and day 2 as I did something else for day 1.

**Thoughts** First two projects were pretty easy. Looking forward to the rest of the course!

### Day 3: November 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I did day 3 of the python course and had a lot of fun. Things are starting to get a tiny bit more complicated, which I like.

**Thoughts** I don't think I like strict indentation programming languages, but I'm starting to enjoy Python.

### Day 4: November 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I did day 4 of the python course and made a rock paper scissors game. I also integrated Twitter API to my dashboard project to pull 5 tweets from my timeline and I also can tweet from my dashboard.

**Thoughts** The python course is too easy so far. I hope it gets more challenging soon!

### Day 5: December 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of python and had a legitimately challenging exercise. I also made Bamboo Forest using Twitter API which allows users to tweet anonymously.

**Thoughts** I got the end result right but I don't know if I did it the _right way_.
